The "APINIZER – Gateway" module is the policy enforcement point of the rules and usage policies you define for your APIs. The request to your APIs first covered by the Gateway and it ensures that the request is passed to the API after applying the defined rules.

- Create gateways/proxies in front of your APIs to apply policies and SLAs
- Create, deploy, undeploy versions of your Gateways independently
- Virtualize and decouple APIs from their clients
- Standardize and centralize APIs’ policies, and make them business centric as it’s supposed to be
